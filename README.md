# bioRNN

A Tensorflow 2 implementation of the RNN described in [Circuit mechanisms for the maintenance and manipulation of working memory](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0414-3).

The Tensorflow 1 implementation is at [Short-term-plasticity-RNN](https://github.com/freedmanlab/Short-term-plasticity-RNN). 

A few basic sanity checks have been done, and the network trains up, but more tests and a thorough review and probably needed before declaring this implmentation "correct."
